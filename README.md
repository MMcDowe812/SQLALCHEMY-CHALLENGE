# SQLALCHEMY-CHALLENGE
MODULE 10 HW CHALLENGE
Received assistance on the App_HW.py portion of the assignment from tutor Lebuso Philly.  He assisted me in getting the first 3 @app.routes created.  Courtney Cole assisted me in first part of the homework.  None of her code was used but her explanations showed me what I was missing.
